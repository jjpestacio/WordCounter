I created a simple word counter for text inputted by a user.
This simple word counter counts the number of characters, words, paragraphs,
and sentences that occur in the user's input. Another functionality is that
it can count the number of occurences of a given string in the input.

This program was created purely with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without
any additional API. I created this simply for practice.
